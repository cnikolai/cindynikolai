    <p><strong>Theories</strong></p>
    <p>Some theories that I have come up with are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>In business, the Goldilocks Principle describes for what quantities one should create or sell products. It states that one should always create/sell a product in at least large, medium, and small sizes. This will cover the widest range of people who want the product.</li>
        <li>In software development, the Goldilocks Principle describes how many features one should include in the software product. It states that one should always create a product with a slimmed-down set of features, a medium set of features, and one with a maximum set of features. This will cover the widest range of people who want and use the product.</li>
        <li>The Golden Rule has been revised by some philosophers to say "treat others as they want to be treated". A new extension is to "treat others as you want to be treated (religious part), treat others as they want to be treated (philosophical part), and treat others as they need to be treated (psychological part). The extension is that one should treat others in a combination of all three of these parts.  A fourth extension is to treat others as Jesus would treat them.  A fifth extension is to treat others "treat others as you want to be treated (religious part), treat others as they want to be treated (philosophical part), and treat others as they need to be treated (psychological part), treat others like it is your last day on earth, and treat others like it is their last day on earth (this one is from Klaus Volpert) (So one doesn’t die with any regrets or ill harm on others when one goes to meet God), and treat other like God would treat them.” The extension is that one should treat others in a combination of all seven of these parts.  The final extension is to treat others like Jesus/God would treat them.</li>
        <li>Love your neighbor as yourself.  An extension to this is love you neighbor as Jesus/God would love them.</li>
        <li>From a humanistic and technical viewpoint, one could argue that evil exists because God is sleeping/resting. (with resting contribution from Beth Hlabse). I also think that the problem of evil should be expanded to how can God be all knowing, all loving, perfect, and always “on,” and there still be evil in the world?</li>
    </ul>
